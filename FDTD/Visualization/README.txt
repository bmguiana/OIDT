This project was completed as part of research conducted with my major professor and advisor, Prof. Ata Zadehgol, at the Applied/Computational Electromagnetics and Signal/Power Integrity (ACEM-SPI) Lab while working toward the Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho, USA. This project was funded, in part, by the National Science Foundation (NSF); award #1816542 [1].

Description:
This is a graphical interface for visualizing 2D simulation data. The program was designed to work in 1360x768 resolution and has only been tested in a Windows 10 environment. 

Directions:
1a. Start setup.exe. There will be a warning on first launch, but clicking on "run anyway" (this button might be hidden behind a "more info" button) will automatically install and launch the program. A second warning will appear before the main application starts.

-or-

1b. Start PDSC_GUI_Development.application. This step is not necessary if running the program from setup.exe.

2. Click any of the selection buttons. This will open a select file dialog.

3. Select an animation *.mp4 file. This will set the host directory for future animation selections and start the default animation file. NOTE: if the animation file is missing, then the media player will display a black screen with blue text reading "ready".

4. Click around and explore. Each button combination is tied to a different animation file. See the below note for more info.

5. Click the "Click to enter fullscreen" button to remove the frame and fill the window (F11 does not work). Since this was originally created to be a long-term display open to the public, there is not a direct method to exit fullscreen mode. To exit from fullscreen mode, use either "Alt+Tab" and close the window through a file explorer or "Alt+F4" to force shut-down the program.

NOTE:

The corresponding animation files are 9.3 MB each, on average, so there are only 3 sample animation files included on GitHub with this release (of the total 324 files generated for this program). These are contained within the VB project folder "animations". For the complete set of animation files, go to the below link:
