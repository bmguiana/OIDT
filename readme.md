## Acknowledgement
This project was completed as part of research conducted with my major professor and advisor, Prof. Ata Zadehgol, as part of the Applied and Computational Electromagnetics Signal and Power Integrity (ACEM-SPI) Lab while working toward the Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho, USA. This project was funded, in part, by the National Science Foundation (NSF); award #1816542 [1].

## Project Description
The OIDT contains two components: (1) Computational electromagnetics (CEM), based on the method of finite-difference time-domain (FDTD), (2) autonomous passive circuit synthesis (PCS). Additional documentation for PCS can be found in [2]. Note that the PCS component is still in its prototype stage, and integration of the CEM and PCS components under OIDT is work-in-progress.
