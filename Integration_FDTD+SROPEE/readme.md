# Instructions
1. Run the S-parameter extraction program contained within the FDTD folders. This will generate a touchstone S-parameter file, TBD.sNp. The current version is compatible with the GPU code only.
2. Copy the resulting S-parameter file TBD.sNp to `SROPEE/Input` to continue with equivalent circuit synthesis and passivity enforcement. Further instructions for this process are included in `SROPEE/Instructions.pdf`.
