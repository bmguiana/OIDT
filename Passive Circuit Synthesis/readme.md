# Optical Interconnect Designer Tool (OIDT)

### Author: Brian Guiana
### Date: 10 December 2021

## Acknowledgement
This project was completed as part of research conducted with my major professor and advisor, Prof. Ata Zadehgol, as part of the Applied and Computational Electromagnetics Signal and Power Integrity (ACEM-SPI) Lab while working toward the Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho, USA. This project was funded, in part, by the National Science Foundation (NSF); award #1816542 [1].

## Project Description
The PCS component is still in its prototype stage, and integration of the CEM and PCS components under OIDT is work-in-progress. Additional documentation for PCS can be found in [2], containing examples showcasing some of its functionality.
